       " 'the one opened the door with a latch-key and went in, followed by a young fellow who awkwardly removed his cap. he wore rough clothes that smacked of the sea, and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious hall in which he found himself. he did not know what to do with his cap, and was stuffing it into his coat pocket when the other took it from him. the act was done quietly and naturally, and the awkward young fellow appreciated it. \"he understands,\" was his thought. \"hell see me through all right.\"',\n",
       " 'he walked at the others heels with a swing to his shoulders, and his legs spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and sinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea. the wide rooms seemed too narrow for his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest his broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the bric-a-brac from the low mantel. he recoiled from side to side between the various objects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged only in his mind. between a grand piano and a centre-table piled high with books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast, yet he essayed it with trepidation. his heavy arms hung loosely at his sides. he did not know what to do with those arms and hands, and when, to his excited vision, one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table, he lurched away like a frightened horse, barely missing the piano stool. he watched the easy walk of the other in front of him, and for the first time realized that his walk was different from that of other men. he experienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so uncouthly. the sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny beads, and he paused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief.',\n",
       " '\"hold on, arthur, my boy,\" he said, attempting to mask his anxiety with facetious utterance. \"this is too much all at once for yours truly. give me a chance to get my nerve. you know i didnt want to come, an i guess your famly aint hankerin to see me neither.\"',\n",
       " '\"thats all right,\" was the reassuring answer. \"you mustnt be frightened at us. were just homely people-hello, theres a letter for me.\"',\n",
       " 'he stepped back to the table, tore open the envelope, and began to read, giving the stranger an opportunity to recover himself. and the stranger understood and appreciated. his was the gift of sympathy, understanding; and beneath his alarmed exterior that sympathetic process went on. he mopped his forehead dry and glanced about him with a controlled face, though in the eyes there was an expression such as wild animals betray when they fear the trap. he was surrounded by the unknown, apprehensive of what might happen, ignorant of what he should do, aware that he walked and bore himself awkwardly, fearful that every attribute and power of him was similarly afflicted. he was keenly sensitive, hopelessly self-conscious, and the amused glance that the other stole privily at him over the top of the letter burned into him like a dagger-thrust. he saw the glance, but he gave no sign, for among the things he had learned was discipline. also, that dagger-thrust went to his pride. he cursed himself for having come, and at the same time resolved that, happen what would, having come, he would carry it through. the lines of his face hardened, and into his eyes came a fighting light. he looked about more unconcernedly, sharply observant, every detail of the pretty interior registering itself on his brain. his eyes were wide apart; nothing in their field of vision escaped; and as they drank in the beauty before them the fighting light died out and a warm glow took its place. he was responsive to beauty, and here was cause to respond.',\n",
       " 'an oil painting caught and held him. a heavy surf thundered and burst over an outjutting rock; lowering storm-clouds covered the sky; and, outside the line of surf, a pilot-schooner, close-hauled, heeled over till every detail of her deck was visible, was surging along against a stormy sunset sky. there was beauty, and it drew him irresistibly. he forgot his awkward walk and came closer to the painting, very close. the beauty faded out of the canvas. his face expressed his bepuzzlement. he stared at what seemed a careless daub of paint, then stepped away. immediately all the beauty flashed back into the canvas. \"a trick picture,\" was his thought, as he dismissed it, though in the midst of the multitudinous impressions he was receiving he found time to feel a prod of indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed to make a trick. he did not know painting. he had been brought up on chromos and lithographs that were always definite and sharp, near or far. he had seen oil paintings, it was true, in the show windows of shops, but the glass of the windows had prevented his eager eyes from approaching too near.',\n",
       " 'he glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books on the table. into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning as promptly as the yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at sight of food. an impulsive stride, with one lurch to right and left of the shoulders, brought him to the table, where he began affectionately handling the books. he glanced at the titles and the authors names, read fragments of text, caressing the volumes with his eyes and hands, and, once, recognized a book he had read. for the rest, they were strange books and strange authors. he chanced upon a volume of swinburne and began reading steadily, forgetful of where he was, his face glowing. twice he closed the book on his forefinger to look at the name of the author. swinburne! he would remember that name. that fellow had eyes, and he had certainly seen color and flashing light. but who was swinburne? was he dead a hundred years or so, like most of the poets? or was he alive still, and writing? he turned to the title-page yes, he had written other books; well, he would go to the free library the first thing in the morning and try to get hold of some of swinburnes stuff. he went back to the text and lost himself. he did not notice that a young woman had entered the room. the first he knew was when he heard arthurs voice saying:-',\n",
       " '\"ruth, this is mr. eden.\"',\n",
       " 'the book was closed on his forefinger, and before he turned he was thrilling to the first new impression, which was not of the girl, but of her brothers words. under that muscled body of his he was a mass of quivering sensibilities. at the slightest impact of the outside world upon his consciousness, his thoughts, sympathies, and emotions leapt and played like lambent flame. he was extraordinarily receptive and responsive, while his imagination, pitched high, was ever at work establishing relations of likeness and difference. \"mr. eden,\" was what he had thrilled to-he who had been called \"eden,\" or \"martin eden,\" or just \"martin,\" all his life. and \" mister !\" it was certainly going some, was his internal comment. his mind seemed to turn, on the instant, into a vast camera obscura, and he saw arrayed around his consciousness endless pictures from his life, of stoke-holes and forecastles, camps and beaches, jails and boozing-kens, fever-hospitals and slum streets, wherein the thread of association was the fashion in which he had been addressed in those various situations.',\n",
       " 'and then he turned and saw the girl. the phantasmagoria of his brain vanished at sight of her. she was a pale, ethereal creature, with wide, spiritual blue eyes and a wealth of golden hair. he did not know how she was dressed, except that the dress was as wonderful as she. he likened her to a pale gold flower upon a slender stem. no, she was a spirit, a divinity, a goddess; such sublimated beauty was not of the earth. or perhaps the books were right, and there were many such as she in the upper walks of life. she might well be sung by that chap, swinburne. perhaps he had had somebody like her in mind when he painted that girl, iseult, in the book there on the table. all this plethora of sight, and feeling, and thought occurred on the instant. there was no pause of the realities wherein he moved. he saw her hand coming out to his, and she looked him straight in the eyes as she shook hands, frankly, like a man. the women he had known did not shake hands that way. for that matter, most of them did not shake hands at all. a flood of associations, visions of various ways he had made the acquaintance of women, rushed into his mind and threatened to swamp it. but he shook them aside and looked at her. never had he seen such a woman. the women he had known! immediately, beside her, on either hand, ranged the women he had known. for an eternal second he stood in the midst of a portrait gallery, wherein she occupied the central place, while about her were limned many women, all to be weighed and measured by a fleeting glance, herself the unit of weight and measure. he saw the weak and sickly faces of the girls of the factories, and the simpering, boisterous girls from the south of market. there were women of the cattle camps, and swarthy cigarette-smoking women of old mexico. these, in turn, were crowded out by japanese women, doll-like, stepping mincingly on wooden clogs; by eurasians, delicate featured, stamped with degeneracy; by full-bodied south-sea-island women, flower-crowned and brown-skinned. all these were blotted out by a grotesque and terrible nightmare brood-frowsy, shuffling creatures from the pavements of whitechapel, gin-bloated hags of the stews, and all the vast hells following of harpies, vile-mouthed and filthy, that under the guise of monstrous female form prey upon sailors, the scrapings of the ports, the scum and slime of the human pit.',\n",
       " '\"wont you sit down, mr. eden?\" the girl was saying. \"i have been looking forward to meeting you ever since arthur told us. it was brave of you-\"',\n",
       " 'he waved his hand deprecatingly and muttered that it was nothing at all, what he had done, and that any fellow would have done it. she noticed that the hand he waved was covered with fresh abrasions, in the process of healing, and a glance at the other loose-hanging hand showed it to be in the same condition. also, with quick, critical eye, she noted a scar on his cheek, another that peeped out from under the hair of the forehead, and a third that ran down and disappeared under the starched collar. she repressed a smile at sight of the red line that marked the chafe of the collar against the bronzed neck. he was evidently unused to stiff collars. likewise her feminine eye took in the clothes he wore, the cheap and unaesthetic cut, the wrinkling of the coat across the shoulders, and the series of wrinkles in the sleeves that advertised bulging biceps muscles.',\n",
       " 'while he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all, he was obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair. he found time to admire the ease with which she sat down, then lurched toward a chair facing her, overwhelmed with consciousness of the awkward figure he was cutting. this was a new experience for him. all his life, up to then, he had been unaware of being either graceful or awkward. such thoughts of self had never entered his mind. he sat down gingerly on the edge of the chair, greatly worried by his hands. they were in the way wherever he put them. arthur was leaving the room, and martin eden followed his exit with longing eyes. he felt lost, alone there in the room with that pale spirit of a woman. there was no bar-keeper upon whom to call for drinks, no small boy to send around the corner for a can of beer and by means of that social fluid start the amenities of friendship flowing.',\n",
       " '\"you have such a scar on your neck, mr. eden,\" the girl was saying. \"how did it happen? i am sure it must have been some adventure.\"',\n",
       " '\"a mexican with a knife, miss,\" he answered, moistening his parched lips and clearing hip throat. \"it was just a fight. after i got the knife away, he tried to bite off my nose.\"',\n",
       " 'baldly as he had stated it, in his eyes was a rich vision of that hot, starry night at salina cruz, the white strip of beach, the lights of the sugar steamers in the harbor, the voices of the drunken sailors in the distance, the jostling stevedores, the flaming passion in the mexicans face, the glint of the beast-eyes in the starlight, the sting of the steel in his neck, and the rush of blood, the crowd and the cries, the two bodies, his and the mexicans, locked together, rolling over and over and tearing up the sand, and from away off somewhere the mellow tinkling of a guitar. such was the picture, and he thrilled to the memory of it, wondering if the man could paint it who had painted the pilot-schooner on the wall. the white beach, the stars, and the lights of the sugar steamers would look great, he thought, and midway on the sand the dark group of figures that surrounded the fighters. the knife occupied a place in the picture, he decided, and would show well, with a sort of gleam, in the light of the stars. but of all this no hint had crept into his speech. \"he tried to bite off my nose,\" he concluded.',\n",
       " '\"oh,\" the girl said, in a faint, far voice, and he noticed the shock in her sensitive face.',\n",
       " 'he felt a shock himself, and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly on his sunburned cheeks, though to him it burned as hotly as when his cheeks had been exposed to the open furnace-door in the fire-room. such sordid things as stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects for conversation with a lady. people in the books, in her walk of life, did not talk about such things-perhaps they did not know about them, either.',\n",
       " 'there was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get started. then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek. even as she asked, he realized that she was making an effort to talk his talk, and he resolved to get away from it and talk hers.',\n",
       " '\"it was just an accident,\" he said, putting his hand to his cheek. \"one night, in a calm, with a heavy sea running, the main-boom-lift carried away, an next the tackle. the lift was wire, an it was threshin around like a snake. the whole watch was tryin to grab it, an i rushed in an got swatted.\"',\n",
       " '\"oh,\" she said, this time with an accent of comprehension, though secretly his speech had been so much greek to her and she was wondering what a lift was and what swatted meant.',\n",
       " '\"this man swineburne,\" he began, attempting to put his plan into execution and pronouncing the i long.',\n",
       " '\"who?\"',\n",
       " '\"swineburne,\" he repeated, with the same mispronunciation. \"the poet.\"',\n",
       " '\"swinburne,\" she corrected.',\n",
       " '\"yes, thats the chap,\" he stammered, his cheeks hot again. \"how long since he died?\"',\n",
       " '\"why, i havent heard that he was dead.\" she looked at him curiously. \"where did you make his acquaintance?\"',\n",
       " '\"i never clapped eyes on him,\" was the reply. \"but i read some of his poetry out of that book there on the table just before you come in. how do you like his poetry?\"',\n",
       " 'and thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject he had suggested. he felt better, and settled back slightly from the edge of the chair, holding tightly to its arms with his hands, as if it might get away from him and buck him to the floor. he had succeeded in making her talk her talk, and while she rattled on, he strove to follow her, marvelling at all the knowledge that was stowed away in that pretty head of hers, and drinking in the pale beauty of her face. follow her he did, though bothered by unfamiliar words that fell glibly from her lips and by critical phrases and thought-processes that were foreign to his mind, but that nevertheless stimulated his mind and set it tingling. here was intellectual life, he thought, and here was beauty, warm and wonderful as he had never dreamed it could be. he forgot himself and stared at her with hungry eyes. here was something to live for, to win to, to fight for-ay, and die for. the books were true. there were such women in the world. she was one of them. she lent wings to his imagination, and great, luminous canvases spread themselves before him whereon loomed vague, gigantic figures of love and romance, and of heroic deeds for womans sake-for a pale woman, a flower of gold. and through the swaying, palpitant vision, as through a fairy mirage, he stared at the real woman, sitting there and talking of literature and art. he listened as well, but he stared, unconscious of the fixity of his gaze or of the fact that all that was essentially masculine in his nature was shining in his eyes. but she, who knew little of the world of men, being a woman, was keenly aware of his burning eyes. she had never had men look at her in such fashion, and it embarrassed her. she stumbled and halted in her utterance. the thread of argument slipped from her. he frightened her, and at the same time it was strangely pleasant to be so looked upon. her training warned her of peril and of wrong, subtle, mysterious, luring; while her instincts rang clarion-voiced through her being, impelling her to hurdle caste and place and gain to this traveller from another world, to this uncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw red caused by the unaccustomed linen at his throat, who, all too evidently, was soiled and tainted by ungracious existence. she was clean, and her cleanness revolted; but she was woman, and she was just beginning to learn the paradox of woman.',\n",
       " '\"as i was saying-what was i saying?\" she broke off abruptly and laughed merrily at her predicament.',\n",
       " '\"you was saying that this man swinburne failed bein a great poet because-an that was as far as you got, miss,\" he prompted, while to himself he seemed suddenly hungry, and delicious little thrills crawled up and down his spine at the sound of her laughter. like silver, he thought to himself, like tinkling silver bells; and on the instant, and for an instant, he was transported to a far land, where under pink cherry blossoms, he smoked a cigarette and listened to the bells of the peaked pagoda calling straw-sandalled devotees to worship.',\n",
       " '\"yes, thank you,\" she said. \"swinburne fails, when all is said, because he is, well, indelicate. there are many of his poems that should never be read. every line of the really great poets is filled with beautiful truth, and calls to all that is high and noble in the human. not a line of the great poets can be spared without impoverishing the world by that much.\"',\n",
       " '\"i thought it was great,\" he said hesitatingly, \"the little i read. i had no idea he was such a-a scoundrel. i guess that crops out in his other books.\"',\n",
       " '\"there are many lines that could be spared from the book you were reading,\" she said, her voice primly firm and dogmatic.',\n",
       " '\"i must a missed em,\" he announced. \"what i read was the real goods. it was all lighted up an shining, an it shun right into me an lighted me up inside, like the sun or a searchlight. thats the way it landed on me, but i guess i aint up much on poetry, miss.\"',\n",
       " 'he broke off lamely. he was confused, painfully conscious of his inarticulateness. he had felt the bigness and glow of life in what he had read, but his speech was inadequate. he could not express what he felt, and to himself he likened himself to a sailor, in a strange ship, on a dark night, groping about in the unfamiliar running rigging. well, he decided, it was up to him to get acquainted in this new world. he had never seen anything that he couldnt get the hang of when he wanted to and it was about time for him to want to learn to talk the things that were inside of him so that she could understand. she was bulking large on his horizon.',\n",
       " '\"now longfellow-\" she was saying.',\n",
       " '\"yes, ive read m,\" he broke in impulsively, spurred on to exhibit and make the most of his little store of book knowledge, desirous of showing her that he was not wholly a stupid clod. \"the psalm of life, excelsior, an i guess thats all.\"',\n",

       " 'once, it entered his mind that there was a deliberate rebuff in all this. he caught her spirit of antagonism and strove to divine the message that her hands pronounced upon the keys. then he dismissed the thought as unworthy and impossible, and yielded himself more freely to the music. the old delightful condition began to be induced. his feet were no longer clay, and his flesh became spirit; before his eyes and behind his eyes shone a great glory; and then the scene before him vanished and he was away, rocking over the world that was to him a very dear world. the known and the unknown were commingled in the dream-pageant that thronged his vision. he entered strange ports of sun-washed lands, and trod market-places among barbaric peoples that no man had ever seen. the scent of the spice islands was in his nostrils as he had known it on warm, breathless nights at sea, or he beat up against the southeast trades through long tropic days, sinking palm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea behind and lifting palm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea ahead. swift as thought the pictures came and went. one instant he was astride a broncho and flying through the fairy-colored painted desert country; the next instant he was gazing down through shimmering heat into the whited sepulchre of death valley, or pulling an oar on a freezing ocean where great ice islands towered and glistened in the sun. he lay on a coral beach where the cocoanuts grew down to the mellow-sounding surf. the hulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue fires, in the light of which danced the hula dancers to the barbaric love-calls of the singers, who chanted to tinkling ukuleles and rumbling tom-toms. it was a sensuous, tropic night. in the background a volcano crater was silhouetted against the stars. overhead drifted a pale crescent moon, and the southern cross burned low in the sky.',\n",
       " 'he was a harp; all life that he had known and that was his consciousness was the strings; and the flood of music was a wind that poured against those strings and set them vibrating with memories and dreams. he did not merely feel. sensation invested itself in form and color and radiance, and what his imagination dared, it objectified in some sublimated and magic way. past, present, and future mingled; and he went on oscillating across the broad, warm world, through high adventure and noble deeds to her-ay, and with her, winning her, his arm about her, and carrying her on in flight through the empery of his mind.',\n",

       " 'he caught a telegraph avenue car that was going to berkeley. it was crowded with youths and young men who were singing songs and ever and again barking out college yells. he studied them curiously. they were university boys. they went to the same university that she did, were in her class socially, could know her, could see her every day if they wanted to. he wondered that they did not want to, that they had been out having a good time instead of being with her that evening, talking with her, sitting around her in a worshipful and adoring circle. his thoughts wandered on. he noticed one with narrow-slitted eyes and a loose-lipped mouth. that fellow was vicious, he decided. on shipboard he would be a sneak, a whiner, a tattler. he, martin eden, was a better man than that fellow. the thought cheered him. it seemed to draw him nearer to her. he began comparing himself with the students. he grew conscious of the muscled mechanism of his body and felt confident that he was physically their master. but their heads were filled with knowledge that enabled them to talk her talk,-the thought depressed him. but what was a brain for? he demanded passionately. what they had done, he could do. they had been studying about life from the books while he had been busy living life. his brain was just as full of knowledge as theirs, though it was a different kind of knowledge. how many of them could tie a lanyard knot, or take a wheel or a lookout? his life spread out before him in a series of pictures of danger and daring, hardship and toil. he remembered his failures and scrapes in the process of learning. he was that much to the good, anyway. later on they would have to begin living life and going through the mill as he had gone. very well. while they were busy with that, he could be learning the other side of life from the books.',\n",
       " 'as the car crossed the zone of scattered dwellings that separated oakland from berkeley, he kept a lookout for a familiar, two-story building along the front of which ran the proud sign, higginbothams cash store. martin eden got off at this corner. he stared up for a moment at the sign. it carried a message to him beyond its mere wording. a personality of smallness and egotism and petty underhandedness seemed to emanate from the letters themselves. bernard higginbotham had married his sister, and he knew him well. he let himself in with a latch-key and climbed the stairs to the second floor. here lived his brother-in-law. the grocery was below. there was a smell of stale vegetables in the air. as he groped his way across the hall he stumbled over a toy-cart, left there by one of his numerous nephews and nieces, and brought up against a door with a resounding bang. \"the pincher,\" was his thought; \"too miserly to burn two cents worth of gas and save his boarders necks.\"',\n",

       " '\"ruth.\" he had not thought a simple sound could be so beautiful. it delighted his ear, and he grew intoxicated with the repetition of it. \"ruth.\" it was a talisman, a magic word to conjure with. each time he murmured it, her face shimmered before him, suffusing the foul wall with a golden radiance. this radiance did not stop at the wall. it extended on into infinity, and through its golden depths his soul went questing after hers. the best that was in him was out in splendid flood. the very thought of her ennobled and purified him, made him better, and made him want to be better. this was new to him. he had never known women who had made him better. they had always had the counter effect of making him beastly. he did not know that many of them had done their best, bad as it was. never having been conscious of himself, he did not know that he had that in his being that drew love from women and which had been the cause of their reaching out for his youth. though they had often bothered him, he had never bothered about them; and he would never have dreamed that there were women who had been better because of him. always in sublime carelessness had he lived, till now, and now it seemed to him that they had always reached out and dragged at him with vile hands. this was not just to them, nor to himself. but he, who for the first time was becoming conscious of himself, was in no condition to judge, and he burned with shame as he stared at the vision of his infamy.',\n",
       " 'he got up abruptly and tried to see himself in the dirty looking-glass over the wash-stand. he passed a towel over it and looked again, long and carefully. it was the first time he had ever really seen himself. his eyes were made for seeing, but up to that moment they had been filled with the ever changing panorama of the world, at which he had been too busy gazing, ever to gaze at himself. he saw the head and face of a young fellow of twenty, but, being unused to such appraisement, he did not know how to value it. above a square-domed forehead he saw a mop of brown hair, nut-brown, with a wave to it and hints of curls that were a delight to any woman, making hands tingle to stroke it and fingers tingle to pass caresses through it. but he passed it by as without merit, in her eyes, and dwelt long and thoughtfully on the high, square forehead,-striving to penetrate it and learn the quality of its content. what kind of a brain lay behind there? was his insistent interrogation. what was it capable of? how far would it take him? would it take him to her?',\n",
       " 'he wondered if there was soul in those steel-gray eyes that were often quite blue of color and that were strong with the briny airs of the sun-washed deep. he wondered, also, how his eyes looked to her. he tried to imagine himself she, gazing into those eyes of his, but failed in the jugglery. he could successfully put himself inside other mens minds, but they had to be men whose ways of life he knew. he did not know her way of life. she was wonder and mystery, and how could he guess one thought of hers? well, they were honest eyes, he concluded, and in them was neither smallness nor meanness. the brown sunburn of his face surprised him. he had not dreamed he was so black. he rolled up his shirt-sleeve and compared the white underside if the arm with his face. yes, he was a white man, after all. but the arms were sunburned, too. he twisted his arm, rolled the biceps over with his other hand, and gazed underneath where he was least touched by the sun. it was very white. he laughed at his bronzed face in the glass at the thought that it was once as white as the underside of his arm; nor did he dream that in the world there were few pale spirits of women who could boast fairer or smoother skins than he-fairer than where he had escaped the ravages of the sun.',\n",
       " 'his might have been a cherubs mouth, had not the full, sensuous lips a trick, under stress, of drawing firmly across the teeth. at times, so tightly did they draw, the mouth became stern and harsh, even ascetic. they were the lips of a fighter and of a lover. they could taste the sweetness of life with relish, and they could put the sweetness aside and command life. the chin and jaw, strong and just hinting of square aggressiveness, helped the lips to command life. strength balanced sensuousness and had upon it a tonic effect, compelling him to love beauty that was healthy and making him vibrate to sensations that were wholesome. and between the lips were teeth that had never known nor needed the dentists care. they were white and strong and regular, he decided, as he looked at them. but as he looked, he began to be troubled. somewhere, stored away in the recesses of his mind and vaguely remembered, was the impression that there were people who washed their teeth every day. they were the people from up above-people in her class. she must wash her teeth every day, too. what would she think if she learned that he had never washed his teeth in all the days of his life? he resolved to get a tooth-brush and form the habit. he would begin at once, to-morrow. it was not by mere achievement that he could hope to win to her. he must make a personal reform in all things, even to tooth-washing and neck-gear, though a starched collar affected him as a renunciation of freedom.',\n",
       " 'he held up his hand, rubbing the ball of the thumb over the calloused palm and gazing at the dirt that was ingrained in the flesh itself and which no brush could scrub away. how different was her palm! he thrilled deliciously at the remembrance. like a rose-petal, he thought; cool and soft as a snowflake. he had never thought that a mere womans hand could be so sweetly soft. he caught himself imagining the wonder of a caress from such a hand, and flushed guiltily. it was too gross a thought for her. in ways it seemed to impugn her high spirituality. she was a pale, slender spirit, exalted far beyond the flesh; but nevertheless the softness of her palm persisted in his thoughts. he was used to the harsh callousness of factory girls and working women. well he knew why their hands were rough; but this hand of hers it was soft because she had never used it to work with. the gulf yawned between her and him at the awesome thought of a person who did not have to work for a living. he suddenly saw the aristocracy of the people who did not labor. it towered before him on the wall, a figure in brass, arrogant and powerful. he had worked himself; his first memories seemed connected with work, and all his family had worked. there was gertrude. when her hands were not hard from the endless housework, they were swollen and red like boiled beef, what of the washing. and there was his sister marian. she had worked in the cannery the preceding summer, and her slim, pretty hands were all scarred with the tomato-knives. besides, the tips of two of her fingers had been left in the cutting machine at the paper-box factory the preceding winter. he remembered the hard palms of his mother as she lay in her coffin. and his father had worked to the last fading gasp; the horned growth on his hands must have been half an inch thick when he died. but her hands were soft, and her mothers hands, and her brothers. this last came to him as a surprise; it was tremendously indicative of the highness of their caste, of the enormous distance that stretched between her and him.',\n",
       " 'he sat back on the bed with a bitter laugh, and finished taking off his shoes. he was a fool; he had been made drunken by a womans face and by a womans soft, white hands. and then, suddenly, before his eyes, on the foul plaster-wall appeared a vision. he stood in front of a gloomy tenement house. it was night-time, in the east end of london, and before him stood margey, a little factory girl of fifteen. he had seen her home after the bean-feast. she lived in that gloomy tenement, a place not fit for swine. his hand was going out to hers as he said good night. she had put her lips up to be kissed, but he wasnt going to kiss her. somehow he was afraid of her. and then her hand closed on his and pressed feverishly. he felt her callouses grind and grate on his, and a great wave of pity welled over him. he saw her yearning, hungry eyes, and her ill-fed female form which had been rushed from childhood into a frightened and ferocious maturity; then he put his arms about her in large tolerance and stooped and kissed her on the lips. her glad little cry rang in his ears, and he felt her clinging to him like a cat. poor little starveling! he continued to stare at the vision of what had happened in the long ago. his flesh was crawling as it had crawled that night when she clung to him, and his heart was warm with pity. it was a gray scene, greasy gray, and the rain drizzled greasily on the pavement stones. and then a radiant glory shone on the wall, and up through the other vision, displacing it, glimmered her pale face under its crown of golden hair, remote and inaccessible as a star.',\n",
       " 'he took the browning and the swinburne from the chair and kissed them. just the same, she told me to call again, he thought. he took another look at himself in the glass, and said aloud, with great solemnity:-',\n",

       " '\"come here, alfred,\" he called to the crying child, at the same time thrusting his hand into his trousers pocket, where he carried his money loose in the same large way that he lived life in general. he put a quarter in the youngsters hand and held him in his arms a moment, soothing his sobs. \"now run along and get some candy, and dont forget to give some to your brothers and sisters. be sure and get the kind that lasts longest.\"',\n",

       " 'during those several weeks he saw ruth half a dozen times, and each time was an added inspiration. she helped him with his english, corrected his pronunciation, and started him on arithmetic. but their intercourse was not all devoted to elementary study. he had seen too much of life, and his mind was too matured, to be wholly content with fractions, cube root, parsing, and analysis; and there were times when their conversation turned on other themes-the last poetry he had read, the latest poet she had studied. and when she read aloud to him her favorite passages, he ascended to the topmost heaven of delight. never, in all the women he had heard speak, had he heard a voice like hers. the least sound of it was a stimulus to his love, and he thrilled and throbbed with every word she uttered. it was the quality of it, the repose, and the musical modulation-the soft, rich, indefinable product of culture and a gentle soul. as he listened to her, there rang in the ears of his memory the harsh cries of barbarian women and of hags, and, in lesser degrees of harshness, the strident voices of working women and of the girls of his own class. then the chemistry of vision would begin to work, and they would troop in review across his mind, each, by contrast, multiplying ruths glories. then, too, his bliss was heightened by the knowledge that her mind was comprehending what she read and was quivering with appreciation of the beauty of the written thought. she read to him much from \"the princess,\" and often he saw her eyes swimming with tears, so finely was her aesthetic nature strung. at such moments her own emotions elevated him till he was as a god, and, as he gazed at her and listened, he seemed gazing on the face of life and reading its deepest secrets. and then, becoming aware of the heights of exquisite sensibility he attained, he decided that this was love and that love was the greatest thing in the world. and in review would pass along the corridors of memory all previous thrills and burnings he had known,-the drunkenness of wine, the caresses of women, the rough play and give and take of physical contests,-and they seemed trivial and mean compared with this sublime ardor he now enjoyed.',\n",

       " '\"but i have not finished my story,\" she said. \"he worked, so father says, as no other office boy he ever had. mr. butler was always eager to work. he never was late, and he was usually at the office a few minutes before his regular time. and yet he saved his time. every spare moment was devoted to study. he studied book-keeping and type-writing, and he paid for lessons in shorthand by dictating at night to a court reporter who needed practice. he quickly became a clerk, and he made himself invaluable. father appreciated him and saw that he was bound to rise. it was on fathers suggestion that he went to law college. he became a lawyer, and hardly was he back in the office when father took him in as junior partner. he is a great man. he refused the united states senate several times, and father says he could become a justice of the supreme court any time a vacancy occurs, if he wants to. such a life is an inspiration to all of us. it shows us that a man with will may rise superior to his environment.\"',\n",

       " 'much of this he strove to express to ruth, and shocked her and made it clear that more remodelling was necessary. hers was that common insularity of mind that makes human creatures believe that their color, creed, and politics are best and right and that other human creatures scattered over the world are less fortunately placed than they. it was the same insularity of mind that made the ancient jew thank god he was not born a woman, and sent the modern missionary god-substituting to the ends of the earth; and it made ruth desire to shape this man from other crannies of life into the likeness of the men who lived in her particular cranny of life.',\n",

       " 'his was the students mind, and behind his ability to learn was the indomitability of his nature and his love for ruth. the grammar he had taken along he went through again and again until his unjaded brain had mastered it. he noticed the bad grammar used by his shipmates, and made a point of mentally correcting and reconstructing their crudities of speech. to his great joy he discovered that his ear was becoming sensitive and that he was developing grammatical nerves. a double negative jarred him like a discord, and often, from lack of practice, it was from his own lips that the jar came. his tongue refused to learn new tricks in a day.',\n",
       " 'after he had been through the grammar repeatedly, he took up the dictionary and added twenty words a day to his vocabulary. he found that this was no light task, and at wheel or lookout he steadily went over and over his lengthening list of pronunciations and definitions, while he invariably memorized himself to sleep. \"never did anything,\" \"if i were,\" and \"those things,\" were phrases, with many variations, that he repeated under his breath in order to accustom his tongue to the language spoken by ruth. \"and\" and \"ing,\" with the \"d\" and \"g\" pronounced emphatically, he went over thousands of times; and to his surprise he noticed that he was beginning to speak cleaner and more correct english than the officers themselves and the gentleman-adventurers in the cabin who had financed the expedition.',\n",
       " 'the captain was a fishy-eyed norwegian who somehow had fallen into possession of a complete shakespeare, which he never read, and martin had washed his clothes for him and in return been permitted access to the precious volumes. for a time, so steeped was he in the plays and in the many favorite passages that impressed themselves almost without effort on his brain, that all the world seemed to shape itself into forms of elizabethan tragedy or comedy and his very thoughts were in blank verse. it trained his ear and gave him a fine appreciation for noble english; withal it introduced into his mind much that was archaic and obsolete.',\n",
       " 'the eight months had been well spent, and, in addition to what he had learned of right speaking and high thinking, he had learned much of himself. along with his humbleness because he knew so little, there arose a conviction of power. he felt a sharp gradation between himself and his shipmates, and was wise enough to realize that the difference lay in potentiality rather than achievement. what he could do,-they could do; but within him he felt a confused ferment working that told him there was more in him than he had done. he was tortured by the exquisite beauty of the world, and wished that ruth were there to share it with him. he decided that he would describe to her many of the bits of south sea beauty. the creative spirit in him flamed up at the thought and urged that he recreate this beauty for a wider audience than ruth. and then, in splendor and glory, came the great idea. he would write. he would be one of the eyes through which the world saw, one of the ears through which it heard, one of the hearts through which it felt. he would write-everything-poetry and prose, fiction and description, and plays like shakespeare. there was career and the way to win to ruth. the men of literature were the worlds giants, and he conceived them to be far finer than the mr. butlers who earned thirty thousand a year and could be supreme court justices if they wanted to.',\n",
       " 'once the idea had germinated, it mastered him, and the return voyage to san francisco was like a dream. he was drunken with unguessed power and felt that he could do anything. in the midst of the great and lonely sea he gained perspective. clearly, and for the first lime, he saw ruth and her world. it was all visualized in his mind as a concrete thing which he could take up in his two hands and turn around and about and examine. there was much that was dim and nebulous in that world, but he saw it as a whole and not in detail, and he saw, also, the way to master it. to write! the thought was fire in him. he would begin as soon as he got back. the first thing he would do would be to describe the voyage of the treasure-hunters. he would sell it to some san francisco newspaper. he would not tell ruth anything about it, and she would be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print. while he wrote, he could go on studying. there were twenty-four hours in each day. he was invincible. he knew how to work, and the citadels would go down before him. he would not have to go to sea again-as a sailor; and for the instant he caught a vision of a steam yacht. there were other writers who possessed steam yachts. of course, he cautioned himself, it would be slow succeeding at first, and for a time he would be content to earn enough money by his writing to enable him to go on studying. and then, after some time,-a very indeterminate time,-when he had learned and prepared himself, he would write the great things and his name would be on all mens lips. but greater than that, infinitely greater and greatest of all, he would have proved himself worthy of ruth. fame was all very well, but it was for ruth that his splendid dream arose. he was not a fame-monger, but merely one of gods mad lovers.',\n",
       " 'arrived in oakland, with his snug pay-day in his pocket, he took up his old room at bernard higginbothams and set to work. he did not even let ruth know he was back. he would go and see her when he finished the article on the treasure-hunters. it was not so difficult to abstain from seeing her, because of the violent heat of creative fever that burned in him. besides, the very article he was writing would bring her nearer to him. he did not know how long an article he should write, but he counted the words in a double-page article in the sunday supplement of the san francisco examiner , and guided himself by that. three days, at white heat, completed his narrative; but when he had copied it carefully, in a large scrawl that was easy to read, he learned from a rhetoric he picked up in the library that there were such things as paragraphs and quotation marks. he had never thought of such things before; and he promptly set to work writing the article over, referring continually to the pages of the rhetoric and learning more in a day about composition than the average schoolboy in a year. when he had copied the article a second time and rolled it up carefully, he read in a newspaper an item on hints to beginners, and discovered the iron law that manuscripts should never be rolled and that they should be written on one side of the paper. he had violated the law on both counts. also, he learned from the item that first-class papers paid a minimum of ten dollars a column. so, while he copied the manuscript a third time, he consoled himself by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars. the product was always the same, one hundred dollars, and he decided that that was better than seafaring. if it hadnt been for his blunders, he would have finished the article in three days. one hundred dollars in three days! it would have taken him three months and longer on the sea to earn a similar amount. a man was a fool to go to sea when he could write, he concluded, though the money in itself meant nothing to him. its value was in the liberty it would get him, the presentable garments it would buy him, all of which would bring him nearer, swiftly nearer, to the slender, pale girl who had turned his life back upon itself and given him inspiration.',\n",
       " 'he mailed the manuscript in a flat envelope, and addressed it to the editor of the san francisco examiner . he had an idea that anything accepted by a paper was published immediately, and as he had sent the manuscript in on friday he expected it to come out on the following sunday. he conceived that it would be fine to let that event apprise ruth of his return. then, sunday afternoon, he would call and see her. in the meantime he was occupied by another idea, which he prided himself upon as being a particularly sane, careful, and modest idea. he would write an adventure story for boys and sell it to the youths companion . he went to the free reading-room and looked through the files of the youths companion . serial stories, he found, were usually published in that weekly in five instalments of about three thousand words each. he discovered several serials that ran to seven instalments, and decided to write one of that length.',\n",
       " 'he had been on a whaling voyage in the arctic, once-a voyage that was to have been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck at the end of six months. while his imagination was fanciful, even fantastic at times, he had a basic love of reality that compelled him to write about the things he knew. he knew whaling, and out of the real materials of his knowledge he proceeded to manufacture the fictitious adventures of the two boys he intended to use as joint heroes. it was easy work, he decided on saturday evening. he had completed on that day the first instalment of three thousand words-much to the amusement of jim, and to the open derision of mr. higginbotham, who sneered throughout meal-time at the \"litery\" person they had discovered in the family.',\n",

       " 'after breakfast he went on with his serial. the words flowed from his pen, though he broke off from the writing frequently to look up definitions in the dictionary or to refer to the rhetoric. he often read or re-read a chapter at a time, during such pauses; and he consoled himself that while he was not writing the great things he felt to be in him, he was learning composition, at any rate, and training himself to shape up and express his thoughts. he toiled on till dark, when he went out to the reading-room and explored magazines and weeklies until the place closed at ten oclock. this was his programme for a week. each day he did three thousand words, and each evening he puzzled his way through the magazines, taking note of the stories, articles, and poems that editors saw fit to publish. one thing was certain: what these multitudinous writers did he could do, and only give him time and he would do what they could not do. he was cheered to read in book news , in a paragraph on the payment of magazine writers, not that rudyard kipling received a dollar per word, but that the minimum rate paid by first-class magazines was two cents a word. the youths companion was certainly first class, and at that rate the three thousand words he had written that day would bring him sixty dollars-two months wages on the sea!',\n",
       " 'on friday night he finished the serial, twenty-one thousand words long. at two cents a word, he calculated, that would bring him four hundred and twenty dollars. not a bad weeks work. it was more money than he had ever possessed at one time. he did not know how he could spend it all. he had tapped a gold mine. where this came from he could always get more. he planned to buy some more clothes, to subscribe to many magazines, and to buy dozens of reference books that at present he was compelled to go to the library to consult. and still there was a large portion of the four hundred and twenty dollars unspent. this worried him until the thought came to him of hiring a servant for gertrude and of buying a bicycle for marion.',\n",
       " 'he mailed the bulky manuscript to the youths companion , and on saturday afternoon, after having planned an article on pearl-diving, he went to see ruth. he had telephoned, and she went herself to greet him at the door. the old familiar blaze of health rushed out from him and struck her like a blow. it seemed to enter into her body and course through her veins in a liquid glow, and to set her quivering with its imparted strength. he flushed warmly as he took her hand and looked into her blue eyes, but the fresh bronze of eight months of sun hid the flush, though it did not protect the neck from the gnawing chafe of the stiff collar. she noted the red line of it with amusement which quickly vanished as she glanced at his clothes. they really fitted him,-it was his first made-to-order suit,-and he seemed slimmer and better modelled. in addition, his cloth cap had been replaced by a soft hat, which she commanded him to put on and then complimented him on his appearance. she did not remember when she had felt so happy. this change in him was her handiwork, and she was proud of it and fired with ambition further to help him.',\n",
       " 'but the most radical change of all, and the one that pleased her most, was the change in his speech. not only did he speak more correctly, but he spoke more easily, and there were many new words in his vocabulary. when he grew excited or enthusiastic, however, he dropped back into the old slurring and the dropping of final consonants. also, there was an awkward hesitancy, at times, as he essayed the new words he had learned. on the other hand, along with his ease of expression, he displayed a lightness and facetiousness of thought that delighted her. it was his old spirit of humor and badinage that had made him a favorite in his own class, but which he had hitherto been unable to use in her presence through lack of words and training. he was just beginning to orientate himself and to feel that he was not wholly an intruder. but he was very tentative, fastidiously so, letting ruth set the pace of sprightliness and fancy, keeping up with her but never daring to go beyond her.',\n",

       " '\"but then, may not i be peculiarly constituted to write?\" he queried, secretly exulting at the language he had used, his swift imagination throwing the whole scene and atmosphere upon a vast screen along with a thousand other scenes from his life-scenes that were rough and raw, gross and bestial.',\n",
       " 'the whole composite vision was achieved with the speed of light, producing no pause in the conversation, nor interrupting his calm train of thought. on the screen of his imagination he saw himself and this sweet and beautiful girl, facing each other and conversing in good english, in a room of books and paintings and tone and culture, and all illuminated by a bright light of steadfast brilliance; while ranged about and fading away to the remote edges of the screen were antithetical scenes, each scene a picture, and he the onlooker, free to look at will upon what he wished. he saw these other scenes through drifting vapors and swirls of sullen fog dissolving before shafts of red and garish light. he saw cowboys at the bar, drinking fierce whiskey, the air filled with obscenity and ribald language, and he saw himself with them drinking and cursing with the wildest, or sitting at table with them, under smoking kerosene lamps, while the chips clicked and clattered and the cards were dealt around. he saw himself, stripped to the waist, with naked fists, fighting his great fight with liverpool red in the forecastle of the susquehanna ; and he saw the bloody deck of the john rogers , that gray morning of attempted mutiny, the mate kicking in death-throes on the main-hatch, the revolver in the old mans hand spitting fire and smoke, the men with passion-wrenched faces, of brutes screaming vile blasphemies and falling about him-and then he returned to the central scene, calm and clean in the steadfast light, where ruth sat and talked with him amid books and paintings; and he saw the grand piano upon which she would later play to him; and he heard the echoes of his own selected and correct words, \"but then, may i not be peculiarly constituted to write?\"',\n",

       " 'so the great discovery began. once before he had tried spencer, and choosing the \"principles of psychology\" to begin with, he had failed as abjectly as he had failed with madam blavatsky. there had been no understanding the book, and he had returned it unread. but this night, after algebra and physics, and an attempt at a sonnet, he got into bed and opened \"first principles.\" morning found him still reading. it was impossible for him to sleep. nor did he write that day. he lay on the bed till his body grew tired, when he tried the hard floor, reading on his back, the book held in the air above him, or changing from side to side. he slept that night, and did his writing next morning, and then the book tempted him and he fell, reading all afternoon, oblivious to everything and oblivious to the fact that that was the afternoon ruth gave to him. his first consciousness of the immediate world about him was when bernard higginbotham jerked open the door and demanded to know if he thought they were running a restaurant.',\n",
       " 'martin eden had been mastered by curiosity all his days. he wanted to know, and it was this desire that had sent him adventuring over the world. but he was now learning from spencer that he never had known, and that he never could have known had he continued his sailing and wandering forever. he had merely skimmed over the surface of things, observing detached phenomena, accumulating fragments of facts, making superficial little generalizations-and all and everything quite unrelated in a capricious and disorderly world of whim and chance. the mechanism of the flight of birds he had watched and reasoned about with understanding; but it had never entered his head to try to explain the process whereby birds, as organic flying mechanisms, had been developed. he had never dreamed there was such a process. that birds should have come to be, was unguessed. they always had been. they just happened.',\n",
       " 'and as it was with birds, so had it been with everything. his ignorant and unprepared attempts at philosophy had been fruitless. the medieval metaphysics of kant had given him the key to nothing, and had served the sole purpose of making him doubt his own intellectual powers. in similar manner his attempt to study evolution had been confined to a hopelessly technical volume by romanes. he had understood nothing, and the only idea he had gathered was that evolution was a dry-as-dust theory, of a lot of little men possessed of huge and unintelligible vocabularies. and now he learned that evolution was no mere theory but an accepted process of development; that scientists no longer disagreed about it, their only differences being over the method of evolution.',\n",
       " 'and here was the man spencer, organizing all knowledge for him, reducing everything to unity, elaborating ultimate realities, and presenting to his startled gaze a universe so concrete of realization that it was like the model of a ship such as sailors make and put into glass bottles. there was no caprice, no chance. all was law. it was in obedience to law that the bird flew, and it was in obedience to the same law that fermenting slime had writhed and squirmed and put out legs and wings and become a bird.',\n",
       " 'martin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living, and here he was at a higher pitch than ever. all the hidden things were laying their secrets bare. he was drunken with comprehension. at night, asleep, he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare; and awake, in the day, he went around like a somnambulist, with absent stare, gazing upon the world he had just discovered. at table he failed to hear the conversation about petty and ignoble things, his eager mind seeking out and following cause and effect in everything before him. in the meat on the platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy back through all its transformations to its source a hundred million miles away, or traced its energy ahead to the moving muscles in his arms that enabled him to cut the meat, and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles to move to cut the meat, until, with inward gaze, he saw the same sun shining in his brain. he was entranced by illumination, and did not hear the \"bughouse,\" whispered by jim, nor see the anxiety on his sisters face, nor notice the rotary motion of bernard higginbothams finger, whereby he imparted the suggestion of wheels revolving in his brother-in-laws head.',\n",
       " 'what, in a way, most profoundly impressed martin, was the correlation of knowledge-of all knowledge. he had been curious to know things, and whatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory compartments in his brain. thus, on the subject of sailing he had an immense store. on the subject of woman he had a fairly large store. but these two subjects had been unrelated. between the two memory compartments there had been no connection. that, in the fabric of knowledge, there should be any connection whatever between a woman with hysterics and a schooner carrying a weather-helm or heaving to in a gale, would have struck him as ridiculous and impossible. but herbert spencer had shown him not only that it was not ridiculous, but that it was impossible for there to be no connection. all things were related to all other things from the farthermost star in the wastes of space to the myriads of atoms in the grain of sand under ones foot. this new concept was a perpetual amazement to martin, and he found himself engaged continually in tracing the relationship between all things under the sun and on the other side of the sun. he drew up lists of the most incongruous things and was unhappy until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them all-kinship between love, poetry, earthquake, fire, rattlesnakes, rainbows, precious gems, monstrosities, sunsets, the roaring of lions, illuminating gas, cannibalism, beauty, murder, lovers, fulcrums, and tobacco. thus, he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it, or wandered through its byways and alleys and jungles, not as a terrified traveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal, but observing and charting and becoming familiar with all there was to know. and the more he knew, the more passionately he admired the universe, and life, and his own life in the midst of it all.',\n",
       " '\"you fool!\" he cried at his image in the looking-glass. \"you wanted to write, and you tried to write, and you had nothing in you to write about. what did you have in you?-some childish notions, a few half-baked sentiments, a lot of undigested beauty, a great black mass of ignorance, a heart filled to bursting with love, and an ambition as big as your love and as futile as your ignorance. and you wanted to write! why, youre just on the edge of beginning to get something in you to write about. you wanted to create beauty, but how could you when you knew nothing about the nature of beauty? you wanted to write about life when you knew nothing of the essential characteristics of life. you wanted to write about the world and the scheme of existence when the world was a chinese puzzle to you and all that you could have written would have been about what you did not know of the scheme of existence. but cheer up, martin, my boy. youll write yet. you know a little, a very little, and youre on the right road now to know more. some day, if youre lucky, you may come pretty close to knowing all that may be known. then you will write.\"',\n",
       " 'he brought his great discovery to ruth, sharing with her all his joy and wonder in it. but she did not seem to be so enthusiastic over it. she tacitly accepted it and, in a way, seemed aware of it from her own studies. it did not stir her deeply, as it did him, and he would have been surprised had he not reasoned it out that it was not new and fresh to her as it was to him. arthur and norman, he found, believed in evolution and had read spencer, though it did not seem to have made any vital impression upon them, while the young fellow with the glasses and the mop of hair, will olney, sneered disagreeably at spencer and repeated the epigram, \"there is no god but the unknowable, and herbert spencer is his prophet.\"',\n",
       " 'but martin forgave him the sneer, for he had begun to discover that olney was not in love with ruth. later, he was dumfounded to learn from various little happenings not only that olney did not care for ruth, but that he had a positive dislike for her. martin could not understand this. it was a bit of phenomena that he could not correlate with all the rest of the phenomena in the universe. but nevertheless he felt sorry for the young fellow because of the great lack in his nature that prevented him from a proper appreciation of ruths fineness and beauty. they rode out into the hills several sundays on their wheels, and martin had ample opportunity to observe the armed truce that existed between ruth and olney. the latter chummed with norman, throwing arthur and martin into company with ruth, for which martin was duly grateful.',\n",
       " 'those sundays were great days for martin, greatest because he was with ruth, and great, also, because they were putting him more on a par with the young men of her class. in spite of their long years of disciplined education, he was finding himself their intellectual equal, and the hours spent with them in conversation was so much practice for him in the use of the grammar he had studied so hard. he had abandoned the etiquette books, falling back upon observation to show him the right things to do. except when carried away by his enthusiasm, he was always on guard, keenly watchful of their actions and learning their little courtesies and refinements of conduct.',\n",
       " 'the fact that spencer was very little read was for some time a source of surprise to martin. \"herbert spencer,\" said the man at the desk in the library, \"oh, yes, a great mind.\" but the man did not seem to know anything of the content of that great mind. one evening, at dinner, when mr. butler was there, martin turned the conversation upon spencer. mr. morse bitterly arraigned the english philosophers agnosticism, but confessed that he had not read \"first principles\"; while mr. butler stated that he had no patience with spencer, had never read a line of him, and had managed to get along quite well without him. doubts arose in martins mind, and had he been less strongly individual he would have accepted the general opinion and given herbert spencer up. as it was, he found spencers explanation of things convincing; and, as he phrased it to himself, to give up spencer would be equivalent to a navigator throwing the compass and chronometer overboard. so martin went on into a thorough study of evolution, mastering more and more the subject himself, and being convinced by the corroborative testimony of a thousand independent writers. the more he studied, the more vistas he caught of fields of knowledge yet unexplored, and the regret that days were only twenty-four hours long became a chronic complaint with him.',\n",
       " 'one day, because the days were so short, he decided to give up algebra and geometry. trigonometry he had not even attempted. then he cut chemistry from his study-list, retaining only physics.',\n",
       " '\"i am not a specialist,\" he said, in defence, to ruth. \"nor am i going to try to be a specialist. there are too many special fields for any one man, in a whole lifetime, to master a tithe of them. i must pursue general knowledge. when i need the work of specialists, i shall refer to their books.\"',\n",

       " '\"but it is unnecessary to have it. we profit from the work of the specialists. thats what they are for. when i came in, i noticed the chimney-sweeps at work. theyre specialists, and when they get done, you will enjoy clean chimneys without knowing anything about the construction of chimneys.\"',\n",

       " '\"youre right, martin,\" olney said. \"you know what youre after, and ruth doesnt. she doesnt know what she is after for herself even.\"',\n",
       " '\" oh, yes,\" olney rushed on, heading off her objection, \"i know you call it general culture. but it doesnt matter what you study if you want general culture. you can study french, or you can study german, or cut them both out and study esperanto, youll get the culture tone just the same. you can study greek or latin, too, for the same purpose, though it will never be any use to you. it will be culture, though. why, ruth studied saxon, became clever in it,-that was two years ago,-and all that she remembers of it now is whan that sweet aprile with his schowers soote-isnt that the way it goes?\"',\n",

       " '\"and why does martin want to write?\" he went on. \"because he isnt rolling in wealth. why do you fill your head with saxon and general culture? because you dont have to make your way in the world. your father sees to that. he buys your clothes for you, and all the rest. what rotten good is our education, yours and mine and arthurs and normans? were soaked in general culture, and if our daddies went broke to-day, wed be falling down to-morrow on teachers examinations. the best job you could get, ruth, would be a country school or music teacher in a girls boarding-school.\"',\n",

       " 'martin followed the discussion closely, and while he was convinced that olney was right, he resented the rather cavalier treatment he accorded ruth. a new conception of love formed in his mind as he listened. reason had nothing to do with love. it mattered not whether the woman he loved reasoned correctly or incorrectly. love was above reason. if it just happened that she did not fully appreciate his necessity for a career, that did not make her a bit less lovable. she was all lovable, and what she thought had nothing to do with her lovableness.',\n",
       " '\"whats that?\" he replied to a question from olney that broke in upon his train of thought.',\n",
       " '\"i was saying that i hoped you wouldnt be fool enough to tackle latin.\"',\n",

       " '\"oh, but its mental training. its mind discipline. its what makes disciplined minds.\" ruth looked expectantly at martin, as if waiting for him to change his judgment. \"you know, the foot-ball players have to train before the big game. and that is what latin does for the thinker. it trains.\"',\n",
       " '\"rot and bosh! thats what they told us when we were kids. but there is one thing they didnt tell us then. they let us find it out for ourselves afterwards.\" olney paused for effect, then added, \"and what they didnt tell us was that every gentleman should have studied latin, but that no gentleman should know latin.\"',\n",

       " '\"its clever all right,\" was the retort, \"but its fair, too. the only men who know their latin are the apothecaries, the lawyers, and the latin professors. and if martin wants to be one of them, i miss my guess. but whats all that got to do with herbert spencer anyway? martins just discovered spencer, and hes wild over him. why? because spencer is taking him somewhere. spencer couldnt take me anywhere, nor you. we havent got anywhere to go. youll get married some day, and ill have nothing to do but keep track of the lawyers and business agents who will take care of the money my fathers going to leave me.\"',\n",

       " 'and all the while, interested in the discussion, martin had been aware of an irk in it as well. it was about studies and lessons, dealing with the rudiments of knowledge, and the schoolboyish tone of it conflicted with the big things that were stirring in him-with the grip upon life that was even then crooking his fingers like eagles talons, with the cosmic thrills that made him ache, and with the inchoate consciousness of mastery of it all. he likened himself to a poet, wrecked on the shores of a strange land, filled with power of beauty, stumbling and stammering and vainly trying to sing in the rough, barbaric tongue of his brethren in the new land. and so with him. he was alive, painfully alive, to the great universal things, and yet he was compelled to potter and grope among schoolboy topics and debate whether or not he should study latin.',\n",
       " '\"what in hell has latin to do with it?\" he demanded before his mirror that night. \"i wish dead people would stay dead. why should i and the beauty in me be ruled by the dead? beauty is alive and everlasting. languages come and go. they are the dust of the dead.\"',\n",
       " 'and his next thought was that he had been phrasing his ideas very well, and he went to bed wondering why he could not talk in similar fashion when he was with ruth. he was only a schoolboy, with a schoolboys tongue, when he was in her presence.',\n",

       " 'he was amazed at the immense amount of printed stuff that was dead. no light, no life, no color, was shot through it. there was no breath of life in it, and yet it sold, at two cents a word, twenty dollars a thousand-the newspaper clipping had said so. he was puzzled by countless short stories, written lightly and cleverly he confessed, but without vitality or reality. life was so strange and wonderful, filled with an immensity of problems, of dreams, and of heroic toils, and yet these stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life. he felt the stress and strain of life, its fevers and sweats and wild insurgences-surely this was the stuff to write about! he wanted to glorify the leaders of forlorn hopes, the mad lovers, the giants that fought under stress and strain, amid terror and tragedy, making life crackle with the strength of their endeavor. and yet the magazine short stories seemed intent on glorifying the mr. butlers, the sordid dollar-chasers, and the commonplace little love affairs of commonplace little men and women. was it because the editors of the magazines were commonplace? he demanded. or were they afraid of life, these writers and editors and readers?',\n",
       " 'but his chief trouble was that he did not know any editors or writers. and not merely did he not know any writers, but he did not know anybody who had ever attempted to write. there was nobody to tell him, to hint to him, to give him the least word of advice. he began to doubt that editors were real men. they seemed cogs in a machine. that was what it was, a machine. he poured his soul into stories, articles, and poems, and intrusted them to the machine. he folded them just so, put the proper stamps inside the long envelope along with the manuscript, sealed the envelope, put more stamps outside, and dropped it into the mail-box. it travelled across the continent, and after a certain lapse of time the postman returned him the manuscript in another long envelope, on the outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed. there was no human editor at the other end, but a mere cunning arrangement of cogs that changed the manuscript from one envelope to another and stuck on the stamps. it was like the slot machines wherein one dropped pennies, and, with a metallic whirl of machinery had delivered to him a stick of chewing-gum or a tablet of chocolate. it depended upon which slot one dropped the penny in, whether he got chocolate or gum. and so with the editorial machine. one slot brought checks and the other brought rejection slips. so far he had found only the latter slot.',\n",
       " 'it was the rejection slips that completed the horrible machinelikeness of the process. these slips were printed in stereotyped forms and he had received hundreds of them-as many as a dozen or more on each of his earlier manuscripts. if he had received one line, one personal line, along with one rejection of all his rejections, he would have been cheered. but not one editor had given that proof of existence. and he could conclude only that there were no warm human men at the other end, only mere cogs, well oiled and running beautifully in the machine.',\n",
       " 'he was a good fighter, whole-souled and stubborn, and he would have been content to continue feeding the machine for years; but he was bleeding to death, and not years but weeks would determine the fight. each week his board bill brought him nearer destruction, while the postage on forty manuscripts bled him almost as severely. he no longer bought books, and he economized in petty ways and sought to delay the inevitable end; though he did not know how to economize, and brought the end nearer by a week when he gave his sister marian five dollars for a dress.',\n",

       " 'there was never an interval when something was not at hand to be done. joe waited for nothing, waited on nothing, and went on the jump from task to task. they starched two hundred white shirts, with a single gathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands, neckband, yoke, and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand. at the same moment the left hand held up the body of the shirt so that it would not enter the starch, and at the moment the right hand dipped into the starch-starch so hot that, in order to wring it out, their hands had to thrust, and thrust continually, into a bucket of cold water. and that night they worked till half-past ten, dipping \"fancy starch\"-all the frilled and airy, delicate wear of ladies.',\n",

       " 'martin learned to do many things. in the course of the first week, in one afternoon, he and joe accounted for the two hundred white shirts. joe ran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel string which furnished the pressure. by this means he ironed the yoke, wristbands, and neckband, setting the latter at right angles to the shirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom. as fast as he finished them, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and martin, who caught them up and \"backed\" them. this task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts.',\n",
       " 'it was exhausting work, carried on, hour after hour, at top speed. out on the broad verandas of the hotel, men and women, in cool white, sipped iced drinks and kept their circulation down. but in the laundry the air was sizzling. the huge stove roared red hot and white hot, while the irons, moving over the damp cloth, sent up clouds of steam. the heat of these irons was different from that used by housewives. an iron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger was too cold for joe and martin, and such test was useless. they went wholly by holding the irons close to their cheeks, gauging the heat by some secret mental process that martin admired but could not understand. when the fresh irons proved too hot, they hooked them on iron rods and dipped them into cold water. this again required a precise and subtle judgment. a fraction of a second too long in the water and the fine and silken edge of the proper heat was lost, and martin found time to marvel at the accuracy he developed-an automatic accuracy, founded upon criteria that were machine-like and unerring.',\n",
       " 'but there was little time in which to marvel. all martins consciousness was concentrated in the work. ceaselessly active, head and hand, an intelligent machine, all that constituted him a man was devoted to furnishing that intelligence. there was no room in his brain for the universe and its mighty problems. all the broad and spacious corridors of his mind were closed and hermetically sealed. the echoing chamber of his soul was a narrow room, a conning tower, whence were directed his arm and shoulder muscles, his ten nimble fingers, and the swift-moving iron along its steaming path in broad, sweeping strokes, just so many strokes and no more, just so far with each stroke and not a fraction of an inch farther, rushing along interminable sleeves, sides, backs, and tails, and tossing the finished shirts, without rumpling, upon the receiving frame. and even as his hurrying soul tossed, it was reaching for another shirt. this went on, hour after hour, while outside all the world swooned under the overhead california sun. but there was no swooning in that superheated room. the cool guests on the verandas needed clean linen.',\n",
       " 'the sweat poured from martin. he drank enormous quantities of water, but so great was the heat of the day and of his exertions, that the water sluiced through the interstices of his flesh and out at all his pores. always, at sea, except at rare intervals, the work he performed had given him ample opportunity to commune with himself. the master of the ship had been lord of martins time; but here the manager of the hotel was lord of martins thoughts as well. he had no thoughts save for the nerve-racking, body-destroying toil. outside of that it was impossible to think. he did not know that he loved ruth. she did not even exist, for his driven soul had no time to remember her. it was only when he crawled to bed at night, or to breakfast in the morning, that she asserted herself to him in fleeting memories.',\n",
       " '\"this is hell, aint it?\" joe remarked once.',\n",
       " 'martin nodded, but felt a rasp of irritation. the statement had been obvious and unnecessary. they did not talk while they worked. conversation threw them out of their stride, as it did this time, compelling martin to miss a stroke of his iron and to make two extra motions before he caught his stride again.',\n",
       " 'on friday morning the washer ran. twice a week they had to put through hotel linen,-the sheets, pillow-slips, spreads, table-cloths, and napkins. this finished, they buckled down to \"fancy starch.\" it was slow work, fastidious and delicate, and martin did not learn it so readily. besides, he could not take chances. mistakes were disastrous.',\n",

       " 'he resolved that when sunday came he would pull himself together and answer ruths letter. but saturday afternoon, after work was finished and he had taken a bath, the desire to forget overpowered him. \"i guess ill go down and see how joes getting on,\" was the way he put it to himself; and in the same moment he knew that he lied. but he did not have the energy to consider the lie. if he had had the energy, he would have refused to consider the lie, because he wanted to forget. he started for the village slowly and casually, increasing his pace in spite of himself as he neared the saloon.',\n",

       " 'but martin made no answer. a few more drinks, and in his brain he felt the maggots of intoxication beginning to crawl. ah, it was living, the first breath of life he had breathed in three weeks. his dreams came back to him. fancy came out of the darkened room and lured him on, a thing of flaming brightness. his mirror of vision was silver-clear, a flashing, dazzling palimpsest of imagery. wonder and beauty walked with him, hand in hand, and all power was his. he tried to tell it to joe, but joe had visions of his own, infallible schemes whereby he would escape the slavery of laundry-work and become himself the owner of a great steam laundry.',\n",

       " 'again, at the week-ends, he ground out the one hundred and forty miles, obliterating the numbness of too great exertion by the numbness of still greater exertion. at the end of three months he went down a third time to the village with joe. he forgot, and lived again, and, living, he saw, in clear illumination, the beast he was making of himself-not by the drink, but by the work. the drink was an effect, not a cause. it followed inevitably upon the work, as the night follows upon the day. not by becoming a toil-beast could he win to the heights, was the message the whiskey whispered to him, and he nodded approbation. the whiskey was wise. it told secrets on itself.',\n",

       " 'the desire to write was stirring in martin once more. stories and poems were springing into spontaneous creation in his brain, and he made notes of them against the future time when he would give them expression. but he did not write. this was his little vacation; he had resolved to devote it to rest and love, and in both matters he prospered. he was soon spilling over with vitality, and each day he saw ruth, at the moment of meeting, she experienced the old shock of his strength and health.',\n",
       " '\"be careful,\" her mother warned her once again. \"i am afraid you are seeing too much of martin eden.\"',\n",
       " 'but ruth laughed from security. she was sure of herself, and in a few days he would be off to sea. then, by the time he returned, she would be away on her visit east. there was a magic, however, in the strength and health of martin. he, too, had been told of her contemplated eastern trip, and he felt the need for haste. yet he did not know how to make love to a girl like ruth. then, too, he was handicapped by the possession of a great fund of experience with girls and women who had been absolutely different from her. they had known about love and life and flirtation, while she knew nothing about such things. her prodigious innocence appalled him, freezing on his lips all ardors of speech, and convincing him, in spite of himself, of his own unworthiness. also he was handicapped in another way. he had himself never been in love before. he had liked women in that turgid past of his, and been fascinated by some of them, but he had not known what it was to love them. he had whistled in a masterful, careless way, and they had come to him. they had been diversions, incidents, part of the game men play, but a small part at most. and now, and for the first time, he was a suppliant, tender and timid and doubting. he did not know the way of love, nor its speech, while he was frightened at his loved ones clear innocence.',\n",
       " 'in the course of getting acquainted with a varied world, whirling on through the ever changing phases of it, he had learned a rule of conduct which was to the effect that when one played a strange game, he should let the other fellow play first. this had stood him in good stead a thousand times and trained him as an observer as well. he knew how to watch the thing that was strange, and to wait for a weakness, for a place of entrance, to divulge itself. it was like sparring for an opening in fist-fighting. and when such an opening came, he knew by long experience to play for it and to play hard.',\n",
       " 'so he waited with ruth and watched, desiring to speak his love but not daring. he was afraid of shocking her, and he was not sure of himself. had he but known it, he was following the right course with her. love came into the world before articulate speech, and in its own early youth it had learned ways and means that it had never forgotten. it was in this old, primitive way that martin wooed ruth. he did not know he was doing it at first, though later he divined it. the touch of his hand on hers was vastly more potent than any word he could utter, the impact of his strength on her imagination was more alluring than the printed poems and spoken passions of a thousand generations of lovers. whatever his tongue could express would have appealed, in part, to her judgment; but the touch of hand, the fleeting contact, made its way directly to her instinct. her judgment was as young as she, but her instincts were as old as the race and older. they had been young when love was young, and they were wiser than convention and opinion and all the new-born things. so her judgment did not act. there was no call upon it, and she did not realize the strength of the appeal martin made from moment to moment to her love-nature. that he loved her, on the other hand, was as clear as day, and she consciously delighted in beholding his love-manifestations-the glowing eyes with their tender lights, the trembling hands, and the never failing swarthy flush that flooded darkly under his sunburn. she even went farther, in a timid way inciting him, but doing it so delicately that he never suspected, and doing it half-consciously, so that she scarcely suspected herself. she thrilled with these proofs of her power that proclaimed her a woman, and she took an eve-like delight in tormenting him and playing upon him.',\n",
       " 'tongue tied by inexperience and by excess of ardor, wooing unwittingly and awkwardly, martin continued his approach by contact. the touch of his hand was pleasant to her, and something deliciously more than pleasant. martin did not know it, but he did know that it was not distasteful to her. not that they touched hands often, save at meeting and parting; but that in handling the bicycles, in strapping on the books of verse they carried into the hills, and in conning the pages of books side by side, there were opportunities for hand to stray against hand. and there were opportunities, too, for her hair to brush his cheek, and for shoulder to touch shoulder, as they leaned together over the beauty of the books. she smiled to herself at vagrant impulses which arose from nowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair; while he desired greatly, when they tired of reading, to rest his head in her lap and dream with closed eyes about the future that was to be theirs. on sunday picnics at shellmound park and schuetzen park, in the past, he had rested his head on many laps, and, usually, he had slept soundly and selfishly while the girls shaded his face from the sun and looked down and loved him and wondered at his lordly carelessness of their love. to rest his head in a girls lap had been the easiest thing in the world until now, and now he found ruths lap inaccessible and impossible. yet it was right here, in his reticence, that the strength of his wooing lay. it was because of this reticence that he never alarmed her. herself fastidious and timid, she never awakened to the perilous trend of their intercourse. subtly and unaware she grew toward him and closer to him, while he, sensing the growing closeness, longed to dare but was afraid.',\n",

       " 'the many hours he was not with ruth he devoted to the \"love-cycle,\" to reading at home, or to the public reading-rooms, where he got more closely in touch with the magazines of the day and the nature of their policy and content. the hours he spent with ruth were maddening alike in promise and in inconclusiveness. it was a week after he cured her headache that a moonlight sail on lake merritt was proposed by norman and seconded by arthur and olney. martin was the only one capable of handling a boat, and he was pressed into service. ruth sat near him in the stern, while the three young fellows lounged amidships, deep in a wordy wrangle over \"frat\" affairs.',\n",
       " 'the moon had not yet risen, and ruth, gazing into the starry vault of the sky and exchanging no speech with martin, experienced a sudden feeling of loneliness. she glanced at him. a puff of wind was heeling the boat over till the deck was awash, and he, one hand on tiller and the other on main-sheet, was luffing slightly, at the same time peering ahead to make out the near-lying north shore. he was unaware of her gaze, and she watched him intently, speculating fancifully about the strange warp of soul that led him, a young man with signal powers, to fritter away his time on the writing of stories and poems foredoomed to mediocrity and failure.',\n",
       " 'her eyes wandered along the strong throat, dimly seen in the starlight, and over the firm-poised head, and the old desire to lay her hands upon his neck came back to her. the strength she abhorred attracted her. her feeling of loneliness became more pronounced, and she felt tired. her position on the heeling boat irked her, and she remembered the headache he had cured and the soothing rest that resided in him. he was sitting beside her, quite beside her, and the boat seemed to tilt her toward him. then arose in her the impulse to lean against him, to rest herself against his strength-a vague, half-formed impulse, which, even as she considered it, mastered her and made her lean toward him. or was it the heeling of the boat? she did not know. she never knew. she knew only that she was leaning against him and that the easement and soothing rest were very good. perhaps it had been the boats fault, but she made no effort to retrieve it. she leaned lightly against his shoulder, but she leaned, and she continued to lean when he shifted his position to make it more comfortable for her.',\n",
       " 'it was a madness, but she refused to consider the madness. she was no longer herself but a woman, with a womans clinging need; and though she leaned ever so lightly, the need seemed satisfied. she was no longer tired. martin did not speak. had he, the spell would have been broken. but his reticence of love prolonged it. he was dazed and dizzy. he could not understand what was happening. it was too wonderful to be anything but a delirium. he conquered a mad desire to let go sheet and tiller and to clasp her in his arms. his intuition told him it was the wrong thing to do, and he was glad that sheet and tiller kept his hands occupied and fended off temptation. but he luffed the boat less delicately, spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to prolong the tack to the north shore. the shore would compel him to go about, and the contact would be broken. he sailed with skill, stopping way on the boat without exciting the notice of the wranglers, and mentally forgiving his hardest voyages in that they had made this marvellous night possible, giving him mastery over sea and boat and wind so that he could sail with her beside him, her dear weight against him on his shoulder.',\n",
       " 'when the first light of the rising moon touched the sail, illuminating the boat with pearly radiance, ruth moved away from him. and, even as she moved, she felt him move away. the impulse to avoid detection was mutual. the episode was tacitly and secretly intimate. she sat apart from him with burning cheeks, while the full force of it came home to her. she had been guilty of something she would not have her brothers see, nor olney see. why had she done it? she had never done anything like it in her life, and yet she had been moonlight-sailing with young men before. she had never desired to do anything like it. she was overcome with shame and with the mystery of her own burgeoning womanhood. she stole a glance at martin, who was busy putting the boat about on the other tack, and she could have hated him for having made her do an immodest and shameful thing. and he, of all men! perhaps her mother was right, and she was seeing too much of him. it would never happen again, she resolved, and she would see less of him in the future. she entertained a wild idea of explaining to him the first time they were alone together, of lying to him, of mentioning casually the attack of faintness that had overpowered her just before the moon came up. then she remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the revealing moon, and she knew he would know it for a lie.',\n",
       " 'in the days that swiftly followed she was no longer herself but a strange, puzzling creature, wilful over judgment and scornful of self-analysis, refusing to peer into the future or to think about herself and whither she was drifting. she was in a fever of tingling mystery, alternately frightened and charmed, and in constant bewilderment. she had one idea firmly fixed, however, which insured her security. she would not let martin speak his love. as long as she did this, all would be well. in a few days he would be off to sea. and even if he did speak, all would be well. it could not be otherwise, for she did not love him. of course, it would be a painful half hour for him, and an embarrassing half hour for her, because it would be her first proposal. she thrilled deliciously at the thought. she was really a woman, with a man ripe to ask for her in marriage. it was a lure to all that was fundamental in her sex. the fabric of her life, of all that constituted her, quivered and grew tremulous. the thought fluttered in her mind like a flame-attracted moth. she went so far as to imagine martin proposing, herself putting the words into his mouth; and she rehearsed her refusal, tempering it with kindness and exhorting him to true and noble manhood. and especially he must stop smoking cigarettes. she would make a point of that. but no, she must not let him speak at all. she could stop him, and she had told her mother that she would. all flushed and burning, she regretfully dismissed the conjured situation. her first proposal would have to be deferred to a more propitious time and a more eligible suitor.',\n",
